        <h1>Hi!</h1>
        <div class="line"></div>
        <p>Established in 1963, Castle Hill High School is a large, coeducational high school set in leafy, well maintained grounds. Academic excellence is prized. It is a school that has a very strong creative and performing arts program and a dynamic sporting tradition. Additionally, the school's student leadership and well being programs are excellent, providing opportunity for students to learn about themselves, work in teams and take initiative. Students and staff are happy, focused and work to support one another in a cooperative environment.
<br><br>
            In order to extend and challenge students, there is a commitment to broad extra-curricula activities including an annual musical production, debating, concert bands, public speaking, dance ensembles, chess club and annual overseas study tours.
<br><br>
            Facilities are extensive and include, for example, six networked computer laboratories, a multi media centre, a photographic darkroom, a performing arts studio, a language conferencing centre and a gymnasium.Recently refurbished classrooms and Science laboratories add to the school's modern and aesthetic appeal.
<br><br>
            The safe and nurturing atmosphere of the school fosters a high standard of student behaviour, marked by self discipline and consideration for others. The school aims to help students become independent learners who have developed the knowledge, skills and confidence necessary to meet the challenges of adult life. </p>
